The acquired data is mainly influenced by two parameters:\n- threshold amplitude\n- duration discrimination time (DDT); if no threshold crossings are detected for the length of DDT,\n  the end of the hit is determined",

We first investigated the noise of the full experiment using a dummy rubber sample with the same detector configuration as in the alloy experiment (see Supplementary Fig. S2).\nWe also measured the noise of the instrument by attaching the detector to the sample grips. \nThe distribution of background noise follows approximately a log normal distribution (see Supplementary Fig. S3) while the maximum noise energy is less than 0.2 aJ.",
